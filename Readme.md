# Project Name

Parallax Website

# Project Description

A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that is kept in place and user can scroll down the page to see different parts of the image. In this article, we are creating a parallax webpage using HTML and CSS. We will use basic tags of HTML like div, paragraph, and heading to write our content and will use CSS to align and beautify our basic HTML design.

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the background of a website moves more slowly than the foreground. The result is a 3D effect as your visitors scroll through your site, adding a sense of depth and providing a more immersive browsing experience.
